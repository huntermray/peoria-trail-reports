Peoria Trail Reporting Web Application
======================================

## Background
This web application was designed to meet requirements of Project 2 in Geography 777 at UW-Madison. The web application is designed around two parks, Kinsey Park and Wildlife Praire Park, located in Peoria, Illinois. These two parks are located on the northwest side of the city, and are primarily used for mountain biking and hiking activities.

This application is centered around a web map containing trail data and utility/points of interest locations for both parks. The map allows user to view, filter, add and update trail reports. The reports contain fields for park/trail name, report type
